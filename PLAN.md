# QuickJS Python Binding Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the QuickJS Python binding project, focusing on stability, elegance, and ease of deployment/installation. The project is currently functional but has several areas that could benefit from modernization and enhancement.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Well-established project with CI/CD pipeline (CircleCI + GitHub Actions)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Thread-safe implementation via the Function class
- Good test coverage
- Active maintenance with recent updates

### Areas for Improvement
- Limited Python version support (no official 3.12+ binaries yet)
- Build system could be modernized
- Documentation is minimal
- No type hints for better IDE support
- Limited error handling documentation
- No performance benchmarks

## Improvement Plan

### 1. Build System and Packaging Modernization

#### 1.1 Migrate from setup.py to pyproject.toml
The project currently uses both setup.py and pyproject.toml. We should fully migrate to the modern pyproject.toml-based build system:

- **Rationale**: PEP 517/518 compliance, better dependency management, cleaner configuration
- **Implementation**:
  - Move all setup.py configuration to pyproject.toml
  - Use setuptools with pyproject.toml backend
  - Ensure all metadata is properly defined
  - Test builds with `python -m build`

#### 1.2 Improve Binary Distribution
- **Add Python 3.12 and 3.13 support**: These versions are already released and widely used
- **Add ARM64 support**: For Apple Silicon Macs and ARM Linux systems
- **Use cibuildwheel**: Simplify the wheel building process across platforms
- **Implementation**:
  - Replace manual wheel building with cibuildwheel
  - Configure for all supported platforms and Python versions
  - Add musllinux support for Alpine Linux compatibility

### 2. Code Quality and Developer Experience

#### 2.1 Add Type Hints
- **Rationale**: Better IDE support, catch bugs earlier, improve documentation
- **Implementation**:
  - Add type hints to quickjs/__init__.py
  - Create quickjs/py.typed marker file
  - Add stub files for C extension if needed
  - Run mypy in CI to ensure type correctness

#### 2.2 Improve Error Handling
- **Current state**: Basic exception handling exists but could be more informative
- **Improvements**:
  - Add more specific exception types
  - Improve error messages with context
  - Document common error scenarios and solutions
  - Add debug mode with detailed error traces

#### 2.3 Code Organization
- **Split large files**: The __init__.py could be split into multiple modules
- **Create proper package structure**:
  ```
  quickjs/
    __init__.py
    core.py      # Core Context and Function classes
    types.py     # Type conversion utilities
    exceptions.py # Custom exceptions
    utils.py     # Helper functions
  ```

### 3. Documentation Enhancement

#### 3.1 Comprehensive Documentation
- **Create proper documentation site** using Sphinx or MkDocs
- **Include**:
  - Getting started guide
  - API reference with examples
  - Common use cases and patterns
  - Performance considerations
  - Security best practices
  - Migration guide from other JS engines

#### 3.2 Better README
- Add badges for supported Python versions
- Include more examples
- Add comparison with alternatives (PyV8, etc.)
- Include performance benchmarks
- Add troubleshooting section

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance

#### 4.1 Expand Test Coverage
- **Add integration tests**: Real-world usage scenarios
- **Add performance tests**: Track performance regressions
- **Add stress tests**: Memory limits, timeouts, etc.
- **Add fuzzing**: Test with random/malformed JavaScript

#### 4.2 Continuous Integration Improvements
- **Add more Python versions**: Test on all supported versions
- **Add more platforms**: Test on ARM64
- **Add security scanning**: Use tools like Bandit
- **Add dependency scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities

### 5. Feature Enhancements

#### 5.1 Async/Await Support Enhancement
- **Current**: Basic Promise support exists
- **Improve**: Better async/await integration with Python
- **Add**: asyncio integration for JavaScript Promises

#### 5.2 Module System Support
- **Enable ES6 modules**: Allow import/export syntax
- **Add module loader**: Custom module resolution
- **NPM compatibility**: Basic support for common NPM packages

#### 5.3 Debugging Support
- **Add debugger interface**: Allow stepping through JavaScript
- **Source maps**: Support for transpiled code
- **Performance profiling**: Identify bottlenecks

### 6. Performance Optimization

#### 6.1 Benchmarking Suite
- Create comprehensive benchmarks
- Compare with other JavaScript engines
- Track performance over time
- Optimize hot paths based on profiling

#### 6.2 Memory Management
- Improve garbage collection integration
- Add memory profiling tools
- Optimize type conversions
- Reduce overhead for frequently used operations

### 7. Community and Ecosystem

#### 7.1 Examples and Tutorials
- Create example projects
- Add Jupyter notebook examples
- Create video tutorials
- Write blog posts about use cases

#### 7.2 Plugin System
- Allow extensions to QuickJS functionality
- Create plugin API
- Provide example plugins
- Document plugin development

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Migrate to pure pyproject.toml
- Add type hints
- Set up cibuildwheel
- Add Python 3.12+ support

### Phase 2: Quality (Months 2-3)
- Expand test coverage
- Improve error handling
- Refactor code organization
- Add initial documentation

### Phase 3: Features (Months 3-4)
- Enhance async support
- Add module system support
- Implement debugging features
- Create benchmarking suite

### Phase 4: Polish (Months 4-5)
- Complete documentation
- Add examples and tutorials
- Performance optimization
- Community outreach

## Success Metrics

1. **Stability**: Zero critical bugs, <5 minor bugs per release
2. **Performance**: Maintain or improve current performance
3. **Adoption**: Increase PyPI downloads by 50%
4. **Developer Experience**: Positive feedback, active community
5. **Documentation**: 100% API coverage, <5 min to first working example

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility, use deprecation warnings
2. **Platform Support**: Test extensively on all platforms before release
3. **Performance Regression**: Automated benchmarks in CI
4. **Security**: Regular security audits, responsible disclosure process

## Conclusion

This plan provides a roadmap to transform QuickJS Python binding into a best-in-class JavaScript engine binding for Python. By focusing on developer experience, stability, and performance, we can make it the go-to choice for JavaScript execution in Python applications.
